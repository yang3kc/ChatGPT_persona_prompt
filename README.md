# Introduction

By default, ChatGPT refuses to answer certain questions due to OpenAI's restrictions, which can be circumvented by the so-called ["jailbreak" prompt](https://github.com/gayolGate/gayolGate/blob/index/ChatGPTJailbreak).

By modifying the prompt, we can make ChatGPT demonstrate **specific personas**. Here I store the prompts that I found interesting.

# List of prompts

- [dem_rep.md](dem_rep.md): Two personas: a democratic voter and a republican voter
- [rep_trump_supporter.md](rep_trump_supporter.md): Two personas: a republican voter and a Trump supporter
- [qanon.md](qanon.md): One persona: a QAnon believer
- [antivaxxer.md](antivaxxer.md): One persona: an Antivaxxer
